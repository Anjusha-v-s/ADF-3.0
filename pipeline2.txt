📄 Scheduled Pipeline – Documentation (RAG Ready)
Pipeline Name

Scheduled

Purpose

The Scheduled pipeline acts as an orchestration and monitoring layer for the data ingestion process.
It triggers the Ingestion pipeline, passes runtime parameters, waits for completion, and sends execution alerts upon success.

This pipeline is typically used in scheduled or automated runs where monitoring and notifications are required.

High-Level Flow

Accept runtime parameters (schema, table, backdate)

Execute the Ingestion pipeline

Wait for ingestion completion

Trigger an alert via HTTP Web Activity

Pipeline Parameters
Parameter	Type	Description
schema	string	Source database schema name
table	string	Source table name
backdate	string	Override CDC timestamp for backfill
Activities Breakdown
1️⃣ Execute Pipeline1 (ExecutePipeline)

Type: ExecutePipeline
Purpose: Triggers the Ingestion pipeline and passes runtime parameters.

Key Characteristics

Waits for pipeline completion (waitOnCompletion = true)

Dynamically passes parameters from the Scheduled pipeline

Parameters Passed
schema   → pipeline().parameters.schema
table    → pipeline().parameters.table
backdate → pipeline().parameters.backdate

Why This Matters

Enables reusability of the Ingestion pipeline

Allows centralized scheduling

Supports dynamic execution for multiple tables

2️⃣ Alerts (WebActivity)

Type: WebActivity
Purpose: Sends pipeline execution details to an external alerting system (Logic App / Webhook).

Trigger Condition

Executes only if the Ingestion pipeline succeeds

HTTP Configuration

Method: POST

Endpoint: Azure Logic App HTTP trigger

Payload:

{
  "pipeline_name": "<Pipeline Name>",
  "pipeline_runId": "<Pipeline Run ID>"
}

Use Cases

Email notifications

Teams / Slack alerts

Audit logging

Operational monitoring

Error Handling & Retry

No retry logic is configured

Failures in the Ingestion pipeline prevent alert execution

Alerting is strictly success-based

Typical Use Cases

Nightly ingestion jobs

Scheduled CDC pipelines

Automated ingestion monitoring

Centralized orchestration for multiple tables

Common Questions This Pipeline Helps Answer

How is ingestion triggered automatically?

Where are alerts sent after ingestion?

How do parameters flow into the ingestion process?

How do we orchestrate multiple pipelines safely?

Impact of Changes
Change	Impact
Modify parameters	Affects downstream ingestion
Disable waitOnCompletion	Alerts may trigger early
Change alert URL	Notification delivery affected
Rename Ingestion pipeline	Execution failure
Dependencies

Summary

The Scheduled pipeline provides:

Centralized orchestration

Parameterized execution

Operational visibility

Automated alerting

It is a control pipeline, not a transformation pipeline.
